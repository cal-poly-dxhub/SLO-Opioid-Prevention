# Opioid Prevention App
This React application uses AWS services DynamoDB, Lambda, APIGateway, and S3 to provide information about opioid overdoses and how to prevent them using Naloxone. Users can fill out a form to have Naloxone in the form of a Narcan nasal spray kit delivered to them. They also have the option to receive text notifications about the status of their order.
